Steps to deploy Docker Images to AWS Elastic Beanstalk (recommended for deploying the backend)

AWS Region

    - Pick the region closet to your current location

AWS Elastic Beanstalk Setup

    Create a EC2 Key Pairs

        - Name -> any name
        - Key pair type -> RSA
        - Private key file format -> .pem (for use with OpenSSH)
        - Once generated, the .pem should be automatically downloaded

    Create App

        Click on this button once the above steps are completed

    Updated the Dockerrun.aws.json file

        Change the environment object for SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL to the RDS-Databases-endpoint in order
        for our Docker Image (web application) to connect to the postgres DB within AWS RDS

    SSH into EC2 instance associated with ECS & EBS

        Head to EC2 instance and copy the Public IPv4 address

        Change to the directory containing the .pem associated with the EC2 instance

            chmod 600 [].pem -> Makes the key pair read-writable only for you

        Run the following command to SSH into EC2 instance

            -> ssh -i [name-of-pem-file].pem [Public IPv4 address]
            -> ssh -i app.pem ec2-user@79.125.54.80

        Once inside the EC2 instance

            - Use the sudo -i command to execute commands from root

            - Use docker run --rm -it postgres:alpine bash to install postgres to this instance and
                execute commands within this postgres instance

            - psql -U [username from RDS postgres db] -d postgres -h [RDS-Databases-endpoint]
                and afterwards enter password [password from RDS postgres db]

            - Once connected to the postgres db from RDS, created the DB for the Docker Image (web application)

    Test your API (Web app)

        - Copy the URL associated with the EBS for your API

        - Use any HTTP Client to test the API

Automatic deployment of Docker Image (API) to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

    Create new User for GitHub Actions Beanstalk Deploy (einaregilsson/beanstalk-deploy@v21)

        Head to Security Management -> leads to Identity and Access Management (IAM) page

        Click on Users section and click on Add users button

            Set user details

                - Specify a username

            Select AWS access type

                - Select AWS credential type -> Access key - Programmatic access

            Set permissions

                Add user to group

            Add user to group

                Click on create group button

                    Specify Group name -> github-actions

                    Attach policies [ AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier, AWSElasticBeanstalkManagedUpdatesCustomerRolePolicy ]

                Click on Create group button once above step is completed

                Select the new group created (attaches group to the user)

            Review

                Click on Next: Tags  and Next: Review to arrive at this page

                Review your choices. After you click on the Create user button, you can view and download the
                autogenerated password and access key

    GitHub Actions Secrets

        Save the Access key ID and Secret access key of above created User as secrets in GitHub repo

    Restart Postgres DB

        DELETE FROM customer;
        ALTER SEQUENCE customer_id_sequence RESTART WITH 1;

Update Dockerrun.aws.json file

    Add the container definition for the frontend client

Update Security Group to allow the backend API to fetch data from Amazon RDS

    View EC2 Security Group used by EBS instance

        Head to EC2 Dashboard

        Under the Resources Section, click on Instances (running) button

        In the Instances table, click on the instance used by EBS from the Instance ID column

        From the Instance summary for x section, click on the Security tab

    View RDS Security Group

        Head to Amazon RDS Dashboard

        Under the Resources Section, click on DB Instances (x/40) link

        From the Databases table, click on the instance of RDS used by EBS under the DB identifier column

        You should be then taken to the RDS used by EBS summary page

            Click on the Connectivity & security tab to see info about RDS Security

        Under the Connectivity & security section, there should be a Security group rules section

            There should be two Security groups

                1. EC2 Security Group - Inbound (from EBS)

                2. CIDR/IP - Outbound (from RDS)

        Note: The Inbound rules used by the Amazon RDS Security Group is inherited from the Inbound rules from the
        EBS Security Group

    Update AWS EBS Security Group

        Follow the steps for the View EC2 Security Group used by EBS instance subsection

        From the Security tab, expand the Security details section

        Under the Security groups subsection, click on the Security group used by EBS (security group name contains AWSEBSecurityGroup)

        From the AWS EBS Security Group page, click on Inbound rules tab and then click the Edit Inbound rules button

            Add Inbound rule for the backend API by clicking on the Add rule button:

                Type: Custom TCP
                Protocol: TCP
                Port range: 8080
                Source: Anywhere -> 0.0.0.0/0 (Internet)
                Description - optional: backend api

            Once completed, click on the Save rules button. Now there should be 3 Inbound rules. The two default Inbound rules
            were added when we created the EBS instance and the last Inbound rule was created to allow backend API
            to fetch data from Amazon RDS connected to the EBS instance
